                <h3>Scope and goal of the project:</h3>
                <p>The goal of the project is to create a new process method of software development by optimizing client-server tier architecture thanks to which significant improvements and optimizations on all tiers of development and support of software will be gained, e.g. reducing costs of human resources and project’s support, reducing size of project’s source code and moving resources to other projects.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Research process contains three (3) phases/research tasks:</h3>
                <p>1.	Creating theoretical model of new method of creating JSQL software</p>
                <p>2.	Research experiments - researching new JSQL software development method</p>
                <p>3.	Creation and demonstration of a prototype of new JSQL software development method</p>
